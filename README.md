# inpost-qr-generator

This is a simple website used to generate QR codes that are used by InPost Parcel Lockers.

The goal of this project is to allow parcel locker users to not have to type the phone number and code into the screen when somebody doesn't send them an app-generated QR code, and instead be able to generate a code themselves.

This project was created using [Remix](https://remix.run) in TypeScript.
